 * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:globalvetlink/hem into master_globalvetlink
 * experimental fix for working with linked modules. Seems like module._findPath always returns the real path if the module is linked so there really insn't any way to tell if it is a linked module, just use the path given? Hopefully this works.
 * small updates to readme preparing for release to master branch and thus npm
 * planning out the feature of adding file versioning for long caching at build time
 * bringing in npm description stuff from version 3 branch
 * few tweak to package json including a version bump
 * lets bump that version#!

 * updated js files
 * tweaks to console output
 * adding noBuild option for only serving static files.
 * no longer used since testacular handles running jasmine tests
 * setting compilers.DEBUG variable from argv.debug value, this way we don't have to keep looking at process.argv in the compilers module

For example to launch the grails app the following json could be used     "spawn" : {       "command" : "grails",       "args"    : ["run-app"],       "options" : { "cwd":"../segway", "stdio": "inherit" }     }

 * working version of hem with connect, but has hardcoded values, will need to change that in next commit
 * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:globalvetlink/hem into master_globalvetlink
